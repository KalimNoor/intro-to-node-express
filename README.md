# node-express-calculator
My first small calculator application using Node &amp; Express

What I learnt & ustilised:
Running the express module on a server using the .listen 
About tapping into the server using .get, get request allows to specify what should happen when our browser makes a get request 
tapping into the server using res which is the response to server when server is triggered 
Downloading a body-parse module which allows me to get access to the form data 
__dirname allowing to grab the file path of t the html file I created and respond to the server is triggered 

How to run application through command line:
1 -browser and go through to the link: http://localhost:3000/
2 -Ensure you are in the correct file path directory in command 
3 -In correct directory run $ npm install express
3 -Ensure nodemon is installed 
3 -Run the command nodemon in command line within the correct project directory 
4 -Refresh link and calculator application will appear ON home page http://localhost:3000/
3 -Bmi calculator will be located on the page http://localhost:3000/bmiCalculator
